This was the final homework for CS 2110 Fall 2014. It implements malloc()
using the buddy system for allocating and deallocating memory.

The variables freelist and heap were provided by TAs so that the homeworks
could be effectively graded.

The files my_sbrk.c, my_sbrk.h, and my_malloc.h were also provided by TAs.
All functions in my_malloc.c were written by me, Nick Graves, and I also
authored the entire test.c file.

All work in this repository is not to be used in any regard with any future
offerings of CS 2110 at Georgia Tech.  My code is provided here as an example
of my previous work.
